# Name Service ZkApp Example

The Name Service zkApp allows users to register names that point to a name record containing data, including a Mina address. Names do not expire. Owners can update their nameâ€™s record and transfer ownership. Only the admin can pause or unpause the zkApp, set the premium rate, and transfer admin rights. For details, check out [Name Service README](/contracts/README.md).

# Offchain State API

[Offchain State API](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/feature-overview/offchain-storage) helps to overcome 8 state field limitation by enabling offchain mappings and fields.

Two types of offchain state are offered: `OffchainState.Field` (a single state field) and `OffchainState.Map` (a key-value map).

- All offchain state is stored in a single Merkle map
- There are no practical limits to the number of state fields and maps
- You can use (pure) provable types of size up to ~16 field elements (~size of an action) for field and map values. (Map keys have unlimited size, since they don't need to be part of the action.)
- Fields support `field.get()`, `field.update(update: {from: value, to: value})`, `field.override(value)` in a contract.
- Maps support `map.get(key)`, `map.update(key, update: {from: value, to: value})` and `map.overwrite(key, value)`.

To use offchain state, a developer must:

- Declare an `OffchainState`
- Call `offchainState.compile()` and `offchainState.setContractInstance()` in the setup phase
- Add a specific on-chain state field to store commitments to the offchain state
- Add a `settle()` method to the smart contract and call it periodically to settle state

Notes:

- State is only available for `get()` after it was settled
- The `settle()` implementation is trivial using the tools `OffchainState` provides
- Settling also involves calling `createSettlementProof()` outside the contract first.

Please refer to [the o1js demo](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/lib/mina/actions/offchain-contract-tests/single-contract-instance.unit-test.ts) for more details on usage.

## Limitations and Warnings

### Concurrency Issue

The Offchain State API allows handling mappings without race conditions. Multiple users can update the values of different keys in the same block. However, in the case of fields, when two users try to update an offchain field at the same time, only one will succeed. The simple workaround is to use an on-chain state field with actions and a reducer when concurrency is a concern.

### Archive Node Dependency

The `OffchainState` uses actions stored in archive nodes instead of a externel data store. Therefore, usage and settlement of the offchain state depends on liveness and speed of archive nodes.  Developers using offchain state in production are encouraged to run their own archive nodes for most reliabliity.

### Scaling

Currently, the entire Merkle tree is reconstructed on the fly by each user from the fetched actions. This approach has limited scalability.

# Settlement

This example includes a settlement module. The module tracks the number of unsettled actions for a zkApp account and settles them when a certain number of actions is reached or when an action remains unsettled for a specified time period. Running the settlement module provides a better user experience than requiring users to request settlements themselves.
For details, please refer to [Settlement Module README](/settlement/README.md).
